This repo uses node version 18 and up you can install with your fav' node manager but here we are using pnpm 
we are trying to make sure we always stay on [lts](https://nodejs.org/en/)

for installing node version 
- pnpm use env lts or 14/18 -g

for listing node envs
- pnpm list env

## What's inside?

This turborepo uses [pnpm](https://pnpm.io) as a package manager. It includes the following packages/apps:

### Apps and Packages

-   `docs`: a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) app
-   `web`: another [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) app
-   `ui`: a stub React component library shared by both `web` and `docs` applications
-   `eslint-config-custom`: `eslint` configurations (includes `eslint-config-next` and `eslint-config-prettier`)
-   `tsconfig`: `tsconfig.json`s used throughout the monorepo

Each package/app is 100% [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

### Utilities

This repository has some additional tools already setup:

-   [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for static type checking
-   [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) for code linting
-   [Prettier](https://prettier.io) for code formatting

### Build

To build all apps and packages, run the following command:

```
cd my-turborepo
pnpm run build
```

### Develop

To develop all apps and packages, run the following command:

```
cd my-turborepo
pnpm run dev
```

To develop one app and packages, by filter run the following command:
```
cd my-turborepo
pnpm run dev --filter={app_name}
```

To add package one app, by filter run the following command:
```
cd my-turborepo
pnpm add {package_name} --filter={app_name}
```

### Remote Caching

Turborepo can use a technique known as [Remote Caching](https://turbo.build/repo/docs/core-concepts/remote-caching) to share cache artifacts across machines, enabling you to share build caches with your team and CI/CD pipelines.

By default, Turborepo will cache locally. To enable Remote Caching you will need an account with Vercel. If you don't have an account you can [create one](https://vercel.com/signup), then enter the following commands:

```
cd my-turborepo
pnpm dlx turbo login
```

This will authenticate the Turborepo CLI with your [Vercel account](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/personal-accounts/overview).

Next, you can link your Turborepo to your Remote Cache by running the following command from the root of your turborepo:

```
pnpm dlx turbo link
```
